# ROS-Line-Follower-Bot
A line follower robot designed on the Robot Operating System (ROS)

## About
The project deals with designing a line follower robot that utilizes certain sensors to gauge the surrounding environment and aid in finding and following a suitable path/track. The proposed algorithm was tried and tested on a minimum of two custom designed tracks.

The Line Follower robot is a WaffleBot that is programmed to follow the lines in its immediate vicinity to determine the path to its destination. The robot's camera scans for the position of the lines and follows them. When a turning in the path is detected, the robot determines whether to turn left or right depending on the position of the line on the camera as seen from the robot’s perspective.
